# AI-Driven Automated Remediation System
# Overview
This system leverages AWS Lambda, AI models from Anthropic (Opus for RCA and Sonnet for code fixes), and various AWS services to automatically analyze and remediate issues in your application stack. It integrates with APM tools like Dynatrace, version control systems like GitHub, and ticketing systems like Jira to automate the entire process.

# Key Features
# Error/Issue Detection: Triggered by events from APM tools.

# Root Cause Analysis (RCA): Uses the Opus model for RCA.

# Code Fixes: Uses the Sonnet model to generate code fixes.

# Model Switching: Logs model switching decisions for RCA and code fixes.

# Automated Actions: Creates GitHub pull requests, raises Jira tickets, or sends notifications.

# Notifications: Webhooks for Slack, Teams, etc., on action completion.

# Core Components
lambda_function.py: Main entry point for the Lambda function.

ai_service.py: Manages interactions with AI models and logs model decisions.

apm_service.py: Integrates with APM tools for issue detection.

ticket_service.py: Handles ticket creation (Jira, etc.).

vcs_service.py: Manages version control system interactions (GitHub).

opensearch_service.py: Manages log storage in OpenSearch.

# Setup
# Environment Variables:

Ensure that the following environment variables are set for Lambda:

ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, OPENSEARCH_ENDPOINT, APM_API_KEY, VCS_TOKEN, etc.

These can be stored in AWS Secrets Manager and accessed by the Lambda function.

# IAM Roles:

Ensure that the Lambda function has necessary permissions for Secrets Manager, CloudWatch, and the relevant APIs (GitHub, Jira, etc.).

# Logging:

Model switching logs can be found in CloudWatch Logs.

# Usage
Invoke the Lambda Function:

The Lambda function is triggered by events from APM tools or other monitoring services.

# Model Decision:

Based on the issue detected, the AI model (Opus or Sonnet) is used. The decision is logged in CloudWatch.

# Automated Actions:

Based on the AI's decision, actions are automatically taken (pull requests, tickets, etc.).

# Troubleshooting
If model switching logs are missing, ensure that the Lambda function is logging properly and that CloudWatch is correctly configured to capture all logs.

# Conclusion
This system automates error detection, root cause analysis, and code remediation, improving operational efficiency and reducing manual intervention. The integration with multiple services ensures a streamlined workflow for resolving issues.
